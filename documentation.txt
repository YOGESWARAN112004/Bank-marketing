Import the required libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.

Load the dataset ('bank-full.csv') into a DataFrame ('df') using pandas.

Explore the dataset by displaying its first 10 rows, checking for missing values, and examining unique values in categorical columns.

Visualize the distribution of the 'age' column using a density plot and calculate basic descriptive statistics for the 'age' column.

Create a histogram to visualize the age distribution by 'y' (subscription) outcome.

Perform statistical tests (chi-squared and one-way ANOVA) to check the association between categorical columns and the 'y' outcome.

Create various visualizations, including density plots, countplots, and boxplots, to explore data distributions and relationships.

Remove outliers from the dataset using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.

Convert binary categorical columns ('default', 'housing', 'loan', 'y') to binary numerical columns (0 and 1).

Drop non-numeric columns from the dataset.

Create a correlation matrix for numeric columns and visualize it using a heatmap.

Use SelectKBest to select the top k features based on ANOVA F-scores.

Define a dictionary of machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, k-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest).

Loop through the models, train them on the training data, and evaluate their accuracy on the test data. Save each model with its accuracy as part of the filename.

Display classification reports for each model, including precision, recall, and F1-score.

The code provides an end-to-end data analysis and machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, and model evaluation.
