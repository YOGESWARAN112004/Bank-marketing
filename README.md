Machine Learning Analysis README
Introduction
This repository contains Python code for performing a machine learning analysis on a dataset. The code covers data exploration, preprocessing, feature selection, model building, and evaluation. It also includes the use of various machine learning algorithms to predict a target variable.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Required libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, Joblib)



Getting Started

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
Install the required libraries using pip:
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn joblib
Download the dataset (bank-full.csv) and place it in the same directory as the code.


Data Exploration

The code begins by importing necessary libraries and suppressing warnings for cleaner output.
The dataset (bank-full.csv) is read using Pandas, and the first 10 rows are displayed.
Information about the dataset, including data types and missing values, is displayed.
Unique values in categorical columns are explored.


A density plot and basic descriptive statistics for the 'age' column are generated.

A histogram showing the distribution of 'age' by 'y' classes is created.

Chi-squared tests and one-way ANOVA tests are conducted to assess associations and differences, respectively, between categorical and numerical columns and the target variable 'y'.

Density plots and countplots are used to visualize the distributions of numerical and categorical columns.


Data Preprocessing

Outliers in numerical columns are detected using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method and removed to improve data quality.
Binary categorical columns ('default', 'housing', 'loan', 'y') are converted to binary numerical columns (0 and 1).
Non-numeric columns are dropped from the dataset.
Feature Selection

The SelectKBest method with the f_classif scoring function is used for feature selection.
The top k features with the highest scores are selected as important features.
Model Building

Several machine learning models are defined and trained on the preprocessed dataset.
Models include Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
Models are saved using Joblib for future use.
Model Evaluation

Each trained model's accuracy is evaluated using the test dataset.
Classification reports are generated for each model, providing precision, recall, and F1-score.
Classification reports include detailed statistics for each class (0 and 1).
Usage

Clone the repository and install the required libraries as mentioned in the "Getting Started" section.
Place the dataset (bank-full.csv) in the same directory as the code.
Run the Python code to perform data exploration, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
